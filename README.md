# llm.jarvis


**llm.jarvis** is a python repository which I implemented to learn how LLMs work. I am planning to integrate all the components of any LLMs in this repository so that you can do small educational experiments with these components.


## Components Implemented So Far

- [x] Self Attention
- [x] Multi-Head Attention
- [x] Feed Forward
- [x] Layer Normalization
- [x] GPT-2
- [x] Sinusoidal Positional Embedding


## To-Do

- [ ] Implement Rotary Positional Embedding
- [ ] Implement Grouped Query Attention
- [ ] Implement Key-Value Caching
- [ ] Implement Flash Attention
